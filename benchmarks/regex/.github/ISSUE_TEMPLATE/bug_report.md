#### What version of regex are you using?

If it isn't the latest version, then please upgrade and check whether the bug
is still present.

#### Describe the bug at a high level.

Give a brief description of the actual problem you're observing.

#### What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?

This section should almost always provide a COMPLETE Rust program that others
can compile and run with Cargo. It should be as small as possible.

If providing a small and simple reproduction is not easy, please explain why
and the maintainers will help you figure out next steps.

#### What is the actual behavior?

If you provide a Rust program in the previous section, then this should be the
output of that program.

#### What is the expected behavior?

What do you expect the output to be?
