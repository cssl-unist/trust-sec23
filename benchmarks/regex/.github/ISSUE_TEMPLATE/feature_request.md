#### Describe your feature request

Please describe the behavior you want and the motivation. Please also provide
examples of how the new feature would be used if your feature request were
added.

The best kind of feature request is one that proposes a concrete change to the
API along with a sketch of the changes to the public API documentation.

If you're not sure what to write here, then try imagining what the ideal
documentation of your new feature would look like. Then try to write it.
