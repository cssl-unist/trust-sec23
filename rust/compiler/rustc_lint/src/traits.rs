    /// ### Example

    /// fn foo<T: Drop>() {}
    /// ```

    /// {{produces}}
    ///
    /// ### Explanation
    ///
    /// `Drop` bounds do not really accomplish anything. A type may have
    /// compiler-generated drop glue without implementing the `Drop` trait
    /// itself. The `Drop` trait also only has one method, `Drop::drop`, and
    /// that function is by fiat not callable in user code. So there is really
    /// no use case for using `Drop` in trait bounds.
    ///
    /// The most likely use case of a drop bound is to distinguish between
    /// types that have destructors and types that don't. Combined with
    /// specialization, a naive coder would write an implementation that
    /// assumed a type could be trivially dropped, then write a specialization
    /// for `T: Drop` that actually calls the destructor. Except that doing so
    /// is not correct; String, for example, doesn't actually implement Drop,
    /// but because String contains a Vec, assuming it can be trivially dropped
    /// will leak memory.
