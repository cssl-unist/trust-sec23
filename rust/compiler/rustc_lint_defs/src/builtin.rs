    /// * If you truly need a mutable global, consider using a [`static`],
    ///   which has a variety of options:
    ///   * Simple data types can be directly defined and mutated with an
    ///     [`atomic`] type.
    ///   * More complex types can be placed in a synchronization primitive
    ///     like a [`Mutex`], which can be initialized with one of the options

    /// without an `unsafe` block.
