/// counters have a counter ID from `1..num_counters-1`.
///
/// `num_expressions` is the number of counter expressions added to the MIR body.
///
/// Both `num_counters` and `num_expressions` are used to initialize new vectors, during backend
/// code generate, to lookup counters and expressions by simple u32 indexes.
///
/// MIR optimization may split and duplicate some BasicBlock sequences, or optimize out some code
/// including injected counters. (It is OK if some counters are optimized out, but those counters
/// are still included in the total `num_counters` or `num_expressions`.) Simply counting the
/// calls may not work; but computing the number of counters or expressions by adding `1` to the
/// highest ID (for a given instrumented function) is valid.
///
/// This visitor runs twice, first with `add_missing_operands` set to `false`, to find the maximum
/// counter ID and maximum expression ID based on their enum variant `id` fields; then, as a
/// safeguard, with `add_missing_operands` set to `true`, to find any other counter or expression
/// IDs referenced by expression operands, if not already seen.
///
/// Ideally, each operand ID in a MIR `CoverageKind::Expression` will have a separate MIR `Coverage`
/// statement for the `Counter` or `Expression` with the referenced ID. but since current or future
/// MIR optimizations can theoretically optimize out segments of a MIR, it may not be possible to
/// guarantee this, so the second pass ensures the `CoverageInfo` counts include all referenced IDs.
