# The Future trait

Initially added: ![Minimum Rust version: 1.36](https://img.shields.io/badge/Minimum%20Rust%20Version-1.36-brightgreen.svg)

In Rust 1.36.0 the long awaited [`Future`] trait has been stabilized!

TODO: this will probably be folded into a larger async section once we're
closer to the next edition.
