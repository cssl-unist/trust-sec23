# Part 1: Building, Debugging, and Contributing to `rustc`

This section of the rustc-dev-guide contains knowledge that should be useful to you
regardless of what part of the compiler you are working on. This includes both
technical info and tips (e.g. how to compile and debug the compiler) and info
about processes in the Rust project (e.g. stabilization and info about the
compiler team).
