# FIXME(mati865): MinGW GCC miscompiles compiler-rt profiling library but with Clang it works
# properly. Since we only have GCC on the CI ignore the test for now.

# ISSUE(76038): When targeting MSVC, Rust binaries built with both `-Z instrument-coverage` and
# `-C link-dead-code` typically crash (with a seg-fault) or at best generate an empty `*.profraw`.
# See ../coverage/coverage_tools.mk for more information.
