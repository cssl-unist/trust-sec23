error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `some_vec`
  --> $DIR/tab_3.rs:7:20
   |
LL |     let some_vec = vec!["hi"];
   |         -------- move occurs because `some_vec` has type `Vec<&str>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
LL |     some_vec.into_iter();
   |              ----------- `some_vec` moved due to this method call
LL |     {
LL |         println!("{:?}", some_vec);
   |                          ^^^^^^^^ value borrowed here after move
   |
note: this function consumes the receiver `self` by taking ownership of it, which moves `some_vec`
