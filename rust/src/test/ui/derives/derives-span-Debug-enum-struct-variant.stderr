LL |      x: Error
   |      ^^^^^^^^ `Error` cannot be formatted using `{:?}`
   |
   = help: the trait `Debug` is not implemented for `Error`
   = note: add `#[derive(Debug)]` or manually implement `Debug`
   = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `Debug` for `&Error`
   = note: required for the cast to the object type `dyn Debug`
   = note: this error originates in a derive macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)

error: aborting due to previous error
