Future incompatibility report: Future breakage date: None, diagnostic:
warning: this method call currently resolves to `<&[T; N] as IntoIterator>::into_iter` (due to autoref coercions), but that might change in the future when `IntoIterator` impls for arrays are added.

LL |     ["hi"].into_iter();
   |            ^^^^^^^^^ help: use `.iter()` instead of `.into_iter()` to avoid ambiguity: `iter`
   |
   = note: `-D array-into-iter` implied by `-D warnings`
   = warning: this was previously accepted by the compiler but is being phased out; it will become a hard error in a future release!
