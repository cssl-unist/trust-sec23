error[E0759]: `self` has an anonymous lifetime `'_` but it needs to satisfy a `'static` lifetime requirement
  --> $DIR/arbitrary_self_types_pin_lifetime_impl_trait-async.rs:8:16

LL |     async fn f(self: Pin<&Self>) -> impl Clone { self }
   |                ^^^^  ----------     ---------- ...and is required to live as long as `'static` here

   |                ...is captured here...

help: to declare that the `impl Trait` captures data from argument `self`, you can add an explicit `'_` lifetime bound

LL |     async fn f(self: Pin<&Self>) -> impl Clone + '_ { self }
