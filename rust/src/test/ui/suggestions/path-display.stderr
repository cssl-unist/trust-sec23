LL |     println!("{}", path);
   |                    ^^^^ `Path` cannot be formatted with the default formatter

   = help: the trait `std::fmt::Display` is not implemented for `Path`
   = note: in format strings you may be able to use `{:?}` (or {:#?} for pretty-print) instead
   = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `std::fmt::Display` for `&Path`
   = note: required by `std::fmt::Display::fmt`
   = note: this error originates in a macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
