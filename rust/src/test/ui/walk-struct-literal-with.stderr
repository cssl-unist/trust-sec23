error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `start`
  --> $DIR/walk-struct-literal-with.rs:16:20

LL |     let start = Mine{test:"Foo".to_string(), other_val:0};
   |         ----- move occurs because `start` has type `Mine`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
LL |     let end = Mine{other_val:1, ..start.make_string_bar()};
   |                                         ----------------- `start` moved due to this method call
LL |     println!("{}", start.test);
   |                    ^^^^^^^^^^ value borrowed here after move

note: this function consumes the receiver `self` by taking ownership of it, which moves `start`
