error[E0277]: the trait bound `NotCopy: Copy` is not satisfied
  --> $DIR/wf-static-type.rs:10:13

LL | struct IsCopy<T:Copy> { t: T }
   |                 ---- required by this bound in `IsCopy`
...
LL | static FOO: IsCopy<Option<NotCopy>> = IsCopy { t: None };
   |             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `Copy` is not implemented for `NotCopy`
   |
   = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `Copy` for `Option<NotCopy>`
