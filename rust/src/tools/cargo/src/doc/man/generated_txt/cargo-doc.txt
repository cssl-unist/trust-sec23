CARGO-DOC(1)

NAME
       cargo-doc - Build a package's documentation

SYNOPSIS
       cargo doc [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Build the documentation for the local package and all dependencies. The
       output is placed in target/doc in rustdoc's usual format.

OPTIONS
   Documentation Options
       --open
           Open the docs in a browser after building them. This will use your
           default browser unless you define another one in the BROWSER
           environment variable.

       --no-deps
           Do not build documentation for dependencies.

       --document-private-items
           Include non-public items in the documentation.

   Package Selection
       By default, when no package selection options are given, the packages
       selected depend on the selected manifest file (based on the current
       working directory if --manifest-path is not given). If the manifest is
       the root of a workspace then the workspaces default members are
       selected, otherwise only the package defined by the manifest will be
       selected.

       The default members of a workspace can be set explicitly with the
       workspace.default-members key in the root manifest. If this is not set,
       a virtual workspace will include all workspace members (equivalent to
       passing --workspace), and a non-virtual workspace will include only the
       root crate itself.

       -p spec..., --package spec...
           Document only the specified packages. See cargo-pkgid(1) for the
           SPEC format. This flag may be specified multiple times and supports
           common Unix glob patterns like *, ? and []. However, to avoid your
           shell accidentally expanding glob patterns before Cargo handles
           them, you must use single quotes or double quotes around each
           pattern.

       --workspace
           Document all members in the workspace.

       --all
           Deprecated alias for --workspace.

       --exclude SPEC...
           Exclude the specified packages. Must be used in conjunction with the
           --workspace flag. This flag may be specified multiple times and
           supports common Unix glob patterns like *, ? and []. However, to
           avoid your shell accidentally expanding glob patterns before Cargo
           handles them, you must use single quotes or double quotes around
           each pattern.

   Target Selection
       When no target selection options are given, cargo doc will document all
       binary and library targets of the selected package. The binary will be
       skipped if its name is the same as the lib target. Binaries are skipped
       if they have required-features that are missing.

       The default behavior can be changed by setting doc = false for the
       target in the manifest settings. Using target selection options will
       ignore the doc flag and will always document the given target.

       --lib
           Document the package's library.

       --bin name...
           Document the specified binary. This flag may be specified multiple
           times and supports common Unix glob patterns.

       --bins
           Document all binary targets.

   Feature Selection
       The feature flags allow you to control the enabled features for the
       "current" package. The "current" package is the package in the current
       directory, or the one specified in --manifest-path. If running in the
       root of a virtual workspace, then the default features are selected for
       all workspace members, or all features if --all-features is specified.

       When no feature options are given, the default feature is activated for
       every selected package.

       --features features
           Space or comma separated list of features to activate. These
           features only apply to the current directory's package. Features of
           direct dependencies may be enabled with <dep-name>/<feature-name>
           syntax. This flag may be specified multiple times, which enables all
           specified features.

       --all-features
           Activate all available features of all selected packages.

       --no-default-features
           Do not activate the default feature of the current directory's
           package.

   Compilation Options
       --target triple
           Document for the given architecture. The default is the host
           architecture. The general format of the triple is
           <arch><sub>-<vendor>-<sys>-<abi>. Run rustc --print target-list for
           a list of supported targets.

           This may also be specified with the build.target config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

           Note that specifying this flag makes Cargo run in a different mode
           where the target artifacts are placed in a separate directory. See
           the build cache
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/build-cache.html>
           documentation for more details.

       --release
           Document optimized artifacts with the release profile. See the
           PROFILES section for details on how this affects profile selection.

   Output Options
       --target-dir directory
           Directory for all generated artifacts and intermediate files. May
           also be specified with the CARGO_TARGET_DIR environment variable, or
           the build.target-dir config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>. Defaults to
           target in the root of the workspace.

   Display Options
       -v, --verbose
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for "very verbose" output
           which includes extra output such as dependency warnings and build
           script output. May also be specified with the term.verbose config
           value <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       -q, --quiet
           No output printed to stdout.

       --color when
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           o  auto (default): Automatically detect if color support is
              available on the terminal.

           o  always: Always display colors.

           o  never: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the term.color config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       --message-format fmt
           The output format for diagnostic messages. Can be specified multiple
           times and consists of comma-separated values. Valid values:

           o  human (default): Display in a human-readable text format.

           o  short: Emit shorter, human-readable text messages.

           o  json: Emit JSON messages to stdout. See the reference
              <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/external-tools.html#json-messages>
              for more details.

           o  json-diagnostic-short: Ensure the rendered field of JSON messages
              contains the "short" rendering from rustc.

           o  json-diagnostic-rendered-ansi: Ensure the rendered field of JSON
              messages contains embedded ANSI color codes for respecting
              rustc's default color scheme.

           o  json-render-diagnostics: Instruct Cargo to not include rustc
              diagnostics in in JSON messages printed, but instead Cargo itself
              should render the JSON diagnostics coming from rustc. Cargo's own
              JSON diagnostics and others coming from rustc are still emitted.

   Manifest Options
       --manifest-path path
           Path to the Cargo.toml file. By default, Cargo searches for the
           Cargo.toml file in the current directory or any parent directory.

       --frozen, --locked
           Either of these flags requires that the Cargo.lock file is
           up-to-date. If the lock file is missing, or it needs to be updated,
           Cargo will exit with an error. The --frozen flag also prevents Cargo
           from attempting to access the network to determine if it is
           out-of-date.

           These may be used in environments where you want to assert that the
           Cargo.lock file is up-to-date (such as a CI build) or want to avoid
           network access.

       --offline
           Prevents Cargo from accessing the network for any reason. Without
           this flag, Cargo will stop with an error if it needs to access the
           network and the network is not available. With this flag, Cargo will
           attempt to proceed without the network if possible.

           Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than
           online mode. Cargo will restrict itself to crates that are
           downloaded locally, even if there might be a newer version as
           indicated in the local copy of the index. See the cargo-fetch(1)
           command to download dependencies before going offline.

           May also be specified with the net.offline config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

   Common Options
       +toolchain
           If Cargo has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to
           cargo begins with +, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain
           name (such as +stable or +nightly). See the rustup documentation
           <https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html> for more
           information about how toolchain overrides work.

       -h, --help
           Prints help information.

       -Z flag
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Cargo. Run cargo -Z help for
           details.

   Miscellaneous Options
       -j N, --jobs N
           Number of parallel jobs to run. May also be specified with the
           build.jobs config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>. Defaults to
           the number of CPUs.

PROFILES
       Profiles may be used to configure compiler options such as optimization
       levels and debug settings. See the reference
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html> for more
       details.

       Profile selection depends on the target and crate being built. By
       default the dev or test profiles are used. If the --release flag is
       given, then the release or bench profiles are used.

       +----------------------------------------+-------------+--------------+
       | Target                                 | Default     | --release    |
       |                                        | Profile     | Profile      |
       +----------------------------------------+-------------+--------------+
       | lib, bin, example                      | dev         | release      |
       +----------------------------------------+-------------+--------------+
       | test, bench, or any target in "test"   | test        | bench        |
       | or "bench" mode                        |             |              |
       +----------------------------------------+-------------+--------------+

       Dependencies use the dev/release profiles.

ENVIRONMENT
       See the reference
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html>
       for details on environment variables that Cargo reads.

EXIT STATUS
       o  0: Cargo succeeded.

       o  101: Cargo failed to complete.

EXAMPLES
       1. Build the local package documentation and its dependencies and output
          to target/doc.
