      "Useful synchronization primitives.\n\n## The need for synchronization\n\nConceptually, a Rust program is a series of operations which will\nbe executed on a computer. The timeline of events happening in the\nprogram is consistent with the order of the operations in the code.\n\nConsider the following code, operating on some global static variables:\n\n```rust\nstatic mut A: u32 = 0;"
