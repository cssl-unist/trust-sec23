//! HIR (previously known as descriptors) provides a high-level object oriented
//! access to Rust code.
//!
//! The principal difference between HIR and syntax trees is that HIR is bound
//! to a particular crate instance. That is, it has cfg flags and features
//! applied. So, the relation between syntax and HIR is many-to-one.
//!
//! HIR is the public API of the all of the compiler logic above syntax trees.
//! It is written in "OO" style. Each type is self contained (as in, it knows it's
//! parents and full context). It should be "clean code".
//!
//! `hir_*` crates are the implementation of the compiler logic.
//! They are written in "ECS" style, with relatively little abstractions.
//! Many types are not self-contained, and explicitly use local indexes, arenas, etc.
//!
//! `hir` is what insulates the "we don't know how to actually write an incremental compiler"
//! from the ide with completions, hovers, etc. It is a (soft, internal) boundary:
